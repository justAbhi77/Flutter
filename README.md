## Me Getting Started with the framework

This repositary is me learning the Flutter framework for creating applications.

The first_app folder contains an android app which displays wordpairs. The user can like/unlike a wordpair. The liked wordpairs are also stored in a file so as to persist between app sessions.

The git_gui folder contains a desktop application(Linux/Mac/Windows) for cloning the users github repo through token.
